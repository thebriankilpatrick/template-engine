# Template Engine  
What follows is the week ten homework for the University of Richmond Coding Boot Camp.  

The Template Engine is a CLI application that generates an html page that displays
cards of a team based on the user's input.  

### Uses and How to Use  
Using the Node Command Line, the application will be invoked with "node app.js"  

The user will then be prompted to answer questions about the team, and its size.  
See the gif below on an example of those prompts.  
For the sake of the gif's size, let's create a team of just one engineer and one intern.

After following the prompts, and creating a team, a team.html page will be generated.  
The team.html page will display the team, in cards by individual.  

Below, I have included a snip it of an example team.html page, with two engineers and two interns.
